1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- mortality Data
3. Data processing
	- Pandas Dataframe
	- Cleaning the dataset
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Label Encoding using LabelEncoder
6.  SMOTE sampling the dataset
7. Splitting the data to train and test 
8. Building the model
-	Logistic Regression
-	Random Forest

-	RNN 
-	LSTM with Autoencoder
-	Voting Classifier (RF + AdaBoost)
-	Stacking Classifier
    
9. Training and Building the model
Flask Framework
----------------
 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend
Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use heart disease Dataset with Machine learning models like LR, RF, XGBoost, RNN and RNN with AE which got  92 %  of test accuracy as per author, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction. 
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier which got 99% accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
